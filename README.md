# React Wordle Clone Project
<br>

This is a ReactJS application that allows users to play the popular Wordle game using any word they would like. Wordle is a simple word game that provides a player with six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess the letters will change colors to provide feedback on whether those letters are in the word and if that letter is in the correct position. The original Wordle uses a random word everyday. This version will allow the user to set the word to any five-letter word they would like.
